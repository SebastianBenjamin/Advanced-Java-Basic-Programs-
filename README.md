# 📘 Advanced Java Practicals 

Welcome to the **Advanced Java Practicals** repository by **Benjamin Sebastian** — a curated collection of hands-on Java programs that explore the powerful capabilities of enterprise-level Java technologies.

This repository served as a **learning journal** and **project archive** during my postgraduate journey at KJ Somaiya Institute of Management, equipping me with in-depth knowledge and real-world experience in building full-stack Java applications.
